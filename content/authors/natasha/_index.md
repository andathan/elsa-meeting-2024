#### Short bio

Natasha is a lecturer in Cybersecurity with special interests in privacy-preserving technologies and mathematical techniques for analysing information leaks in secure systems. She holds an undergraduate degree in Pure Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Sydney, and a PhD in Computing from Macquarie University and Ã‰cole Polytechnique in France. 
Natasha's research interests are in the mathematical foundations of data privacy, particularly involving differential privacy, natural language processing or machine learning. Her work involves probabilistic reasoning using quantitative information flow techniques which derive from information-theoretic principles.
