#### Title: Conversational AI Ethics: Philosophy and Real-World Case Studies

##### Abstract
In the rapidly changing landscape of Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking a central role in both industry and academia. However, this swift progression brings forth ethical dilemmas and possible societal repercussions. The keynote will explore the philosophical foundations of ethics as they relate to ML and delve into real-world case studies. Specifically, it will highlight open science initiatives like BigScience, which collaboratively developed and deployed a multilingual LLM, BLOOM, and its accompanying dataset, ROOTS.
