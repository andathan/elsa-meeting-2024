        It's the year 2035, and Julie is walking briskly towards a train station, headphones plugged in, to the rhythm of a lively soundtrack. She crosses at a red light, thinking without saying a word that she's not endangering anyone. However, her headset, one of whose functions is to control, regulate and monitor her mental state, picks up her brainwaves corresponding to her intention to cross, sends them, via Bluetooth, to the police, who arrest her for breaking the rules. She is then registered and fined. This science-fiction world is just around the corner, and it makes me wonder. Do I want my innermost thoughts and intentions to be available to everyone? What role does science-fiction play in their development? How do we articulate the convergence of AI and neuroscience? Neurotechnologies are brain-machine devices that enable us to study the structure and functioning of the brain. They are being developed in academic and companies and are already being marketed to a healthy public. In a society where economic necessity dominates, they offer hope, but their capacity to influence or manipulate people is worrying. The boundary between medical and non-medical uses, civil and military, is becoming very porous. My project is to consider ethics as the constructive criticism of all projects, to protect our future from our present actions. My aim is to determine what ethics are desirable for these neurotechnologies. I seek to define the consequences of their use on human identity and society, drawing on neuroscience and philosophy. Let's come back to Julie to understand. Her helmet has built-in electrodes to record her brain activity. An AI will take over and process this information, intervening to modify her brain activity. One of the first ethical issues is that of mental privacy. Julie's helmet gives access to what she thinks, and she is reprimanded for it. As the brain is the last refuge of our privacy, their development calls for ethical vigilance in the face of the risk of violating personal integrity and freedom of thought. The challenge is to devise an ethic that looks to the future of human rights.
