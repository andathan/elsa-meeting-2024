      title: Dual Use Concerns of Generative AI and Large Language Models
      subtitle: Laurynas Adomaitis <br/> *CEA/Saclay*

        We suggest the implementation of the Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) framework, originally designed for life sciences, to the domain of generative AI, with a specific focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). With its demonstrated advantages and drawbacks in biological research, we believe the DURC criteria can be effectively redefined for LLMs, potentially contributing to improved AI governance. Acknowledging the balance that must be struck when employing the DURC framework, we highlight its crucial political role in enhancing societal awareness of the impact of generative AI. As a final point, we offer a series of specific recommendations for applying the DURC approach to LLM research.
